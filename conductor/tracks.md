# Project Tracks

This file tracks all major tracks for the project. Each track has its own detailed plan in its respective folder.\n---\n\n## [~] Track: setup a github actions pipeline that's lightweight but that confirms our linting, and test coverage, let's also make sure our README is clean and up to date with testing / coverage information. Let's implement precommit checks so that linting and test coverage isnt violated too\n*Link: [./conductor/tracks/ci_precommit_20251222/](./conductor/tracks/ci_precommit_20251222/)*
