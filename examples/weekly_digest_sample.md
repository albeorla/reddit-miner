# Sample Weekly Digest: r/SideProject

*Generated by Pain Radar*

I analyzed posts in r/SideProject from the past week to find repeated struggles. Here are the top 5 patterns I found.

### 1. Stripe Connect Nightmares for Marketplace Builders

**The pattern:** Indie hackers building marketplaces consistently struggle with Stripe Connect's complex onboarding flow and payout edge cases.

**What people are saying:**

> "3 weeks trying to get Connect working. The documentation assumes you already know Stripe well."

> "Every time I think I understand the payout schedule, an edge case breaks it."

**Who this affects:** Solo founders building marketplace MVPs

### 2. Landing Page Paralysis

**The pattern:** Builders spend weeks on landing pages instead of shipping, often due to lack of good templates for their niche.

**What people are saying:**

> "I've rewritten my landing page 5 times. Still not happy with it."

> "Most templates are for SaaS, but I'm building a course. Nothing fits."

**Who this affects:** First-time founders, non-designers

### 3. Email Deliverability Hell

**The pattern:** New products struggle to get past spam filters, especially transactional emails that customers actually need.

**What people are saying:**

> "Password reset emails going to spam. Users think our app is broken."

> "Spent more time on email setup than building features."

**Who this affects:** New launches, B2C products

### 4. Analytics Overwhelm

**The pattern:** Too many analytics tools, not enough actionable insights. Founders don't know which metrics matter.

**What people are saying:**

> "I have GA, Mixpanel, and Amplitude. Still don't know if people use my product."

> "What's a good DAU for a side project? No benchmarks anywhere."

**Who this affects:** Data-anxious founders

### 5. First User Acquisition Anxiety

**The pattern:** Product is ready but founders don't know how to get their first 10 users without spending money or feeling spammy.

**What people are saying:**

> "Where do you post without sounding desperate or promotional?"

> "Every 'launch checklist' says 'post on Reddit' but that gets you banned."

**Who this affects:** Bootstrappers, first-time launchers

**Sources:** [Thread 1](https://reddit.com), [Thread 2](https://reddit.com)
