## Template 5: The Gentle Redirect

Use when someone is asking the wrong question.

Good question. Based on tracking similar threads, I've noticed the underlying issue is usually [real problem], not [stated problem].

The pattern I see:
- [Symptom 1] → usually caused by [root cause]
- [Symptom 2] → usually caused by [root cause]

Might be worth checking [specific thing] first. Here's a thread where someone had the same symptoms but a different root cause: [link]

Does that help narrow it down?
